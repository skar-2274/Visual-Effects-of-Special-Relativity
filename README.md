# Visual-Effects-of-Special-Relativity
Simulations to show the distortion of objects under relativistic conditions.

Relativistic_Aberration.py allows the user to input desired images to observe spatial distortion as a result of relativistic conditions.

Relativistic_Cube.py allows the user to simulate a cube to apply relativistic velocities in any direction and adjust the observer's position freely in space.

Relativistic_Doppler_Effect.py shows a simulation of light rays with redshift/blueshift as it approaches relativistic velocities with the user in control of the 
number of rays they can see.

Simulation_of_Points_in_Space.py allows the user to obverse a randomly generated universe with objects represented as point masses under relativistic conditions with redshift/blueshift available to toggle. The user can adjust the observer's position as they wish.

In all codes, the user controls the velocities ranging between -99.9%-99.9% of the speed of light.
